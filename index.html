         <img src="Images/Aaron.jpg" alt="Picture">
         <p> My name is Aaron Zacharia Mathew, my student number is s3944964 and my student email is s3944964@student.rmit.edu.au. I am 18
            <br> years old; my nationality is Australian and my culture is Indian and I am currently a first year student at RMIT doing Bachelor
            <br> of Information Technology. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, playing piano, watching tv shows, playing basketball and watching Formula 1.

            <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
            <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
               <br> Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience.
            </h3>
            <p>
               I am in interested in IT as I believe it to be a great field that will experience growth soon.
               <br> My interest in IT began during year 12 as I was figuring out which direction to head in for a career.
               <br> After doing some research and speaking to some friends and family I found that IT would be a field
               <br> that would have great value in the future.
            </p>
            <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
            <p>
               I chose to come to RMIT as I wanted to complete my studies for IT at a more practical university.
               <br> I have always found that I understand what I’m learning better when it’s through practical work
               <br> rather than full theoretical work. When I was searching for different IT courses at universities
               <br> I asked around and found that universities such as Monash and Melbourne focused on more theoretical
               <br> work rather than practical. This led me to wanting to join RMIT.
            </p>
            <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
            <p>
               I expect to learn different IT skills such as programming, different programming languages,
               <br> problem solving skills and analytical abilities. I would like to learn about managing IT
               <br> projects, about data structures user interface and user experience and testing.
               <br> I would also like to learn about networking.

         <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
         <p> These results show me that I, tend to be more Introverted than extraverted, use my feelings
            <br> to make decisions more than I use thinking for decisions. They show that I am highly observant
            <br> meaning that I am practical and focus more on the present rather than worrying about the future.
            <br> These results show me that I use my feelings to make decisions more than I use thinking for decisions.
            <br> They show that I tend to not just rush headfirst into a problem but stayback to observe and understand
            <br> the issue first before creating a strategy. They also determine that I am a friendly person and highly
            <br> optimistic.
         </p>
         <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
         <p>
            These results show that I would be useful in a group as I would prefer to plan out the strategies
            <br> needed to tackle the issues we face. I would also be able to communicate well with the team and
            <br> maintain healthy relationships with each of the members with a friendly attitude. However, according
            <br> to the adventurer personality I might display extreme competitiveness which can be harmful for a team.
            <br> The ideas I provide to the team would be more conventional which may not always be the best way to tackle
            <br> something.
         </p>
         <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
         <p>
            I should be focused on things like making sure all team members ideas are heard and thoroughly
            <br> discussed about before the group comes to a decision. To prevent the trait of being extremely
            <br> competitive I should keep in mind the main goal of the group which is to complete the assignment
            <br> and recognise that everyone functioning together in unity provides the best result. I should also
            <br> make sure all group members share their ideas so we can use some abstract ones during the project.
         </p>
         <a name="ProjectIdea"></a>
         <h2>Project Idea</h2>
         <h3>Overview</h3>
         <p>
            My project idea is to create a groceries shopping list mobile app that is able to compare the
            <br> prices between different stores. The application allows for the user to search for whatever
            <br> product they require, and the app then provides them with a list of the product from different
            <br> providers and stores while highlighting their prices. It also shows where the product is sold
            <br> with the highest discount from and determines the nearest store the user could purchase the
            <br> product from.
         </p>
         <h3>Motivation</h3>
         <p>This product allows for users to determine where they are able to purchase their desired project
            <br>for the best price. The app also allows for users to determine how far the store is from them
            <br>allowing them to plan out their journey if needed. ‘Some supermarket items could rise by 10 to 20
            <br>per cent as suppliers struggle with higher charges for packaging and transport due to rising fuel
            <br>costs (Foster 2022, para. 1). As a frequent shopper as well, I would enjoy an app like this that
            <br>would let me fit all my groceries into my personal budget and ensure I get the best bang for my buck.
         </p>
         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p>
            The product is an app that can made using React Native, which is a JavaScript framework that is used
            <br>for creating mobile applications, and Firebase, which is a database software used for developing mobile
            <br> applications. The app can be downloaded on both iOS and android, that allows users to search on the search
            <br> bar for specific products and find out their prices and how much discount is placed on the product. The app
            <br> is capable of providing the user with the distance of the nearest stores from ascending order (closest to farthest),
            <br> making it an easy experience for the user. An example for this could be that a user is looking for chocolate syrup,
            <br> they would then type that into the search bar and press enter.
         </p>
         <p>
            <br>Following this the app would give the results showing different results of chocolate syrup such as different
            <br>brands from each store. The results displayed would also show the price for the user to see. To proceed the
            <br>user would click on the brand of chocolate syrup from a store they wanted it would proceed to take them to a
            <br>new page where they would be able to input their postcode, suburb or even allow access to location, which will
            <br>then allow for the app to determine which branches of the specific store the customer chose are the nearest to them
            <br>as well as the operating hours of the store. From here the user is able to go to the nearest store which was
            <br>displayed and purchase their item. The user is able to navigate out of the pages at any moment with a back button
            <br>which the user is able to use at any point if they wish to change the product they want to search or want to exit
            <br>the app.
         </p>
         <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
         <p>
           This app requires the use of React Native. This will be used to create the interface of the mobile application. React Native
          <br>is similar to React in terms of its code making it easy to learn whilst also having a huge community of people that are willing
          <br> to help if need be. Since this is a mobile application, React Native enables the app to be cross-platform which allows it to run
          <br> on both IOS and Android. It will also use Firebase, which is used to pair with the user interface, Firebase will be used as the
          <br>database of choice. It is free and allows app to store and retrieve all the data that is needed.
         </p>
         <h3>Skills Required</h3>
         <p>
            The three biggest skills required would be configuring, programming, and debugging. In regard to configuring,
            <br> all the necessary libraries packages would have to be installed for both React Native and Firebase to work properly.
            <br> To add to this, programs such as VSCode, Android Studio and XCode would be needed so that code can be written and
            <br> tested on both IOS and Android virtual devices. Once things are configured, problem solving and critical thinking
            <br> skills must be used to write code and make the application and to finalize, the skill of debugging is required to
            <br> understand any bugs and how they can be fixed. These are all feasible skills to have as they are mandatory in the
            <br> development of software and as a result, must be learnt.
         </p>
         <h3>Outcome</h3>
         <p>
            If the app is successful, it will allow its users to save money on their purchases which will lead to greater
            <br>savings in the long run. The app gives users the ability to check prices at ease without having to search the
            <br>products one by one through each store website. Ultimately the product allows users to save both money and time
            <br>in the long run.
